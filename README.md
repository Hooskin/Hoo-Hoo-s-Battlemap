# Hoo Hoo's Battlemaps

**Bonjour, fellow adventurers!**

Welcome to my collection of battlemaps, crafted with passion using Forgotten Adventures assets. As a lover of TTRPGs, I know the importance of having beautiful and immersive battlemaps for your games. When I first started, I yearned for those pretty battlemaps, and now, I’m excited to share mine with you—all for free!

## What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you will find a variety of battlemaps, each designed to enhance your gameplay experience. These maps are free to use in anyone's game. Whether you're delving into dungeons, exploring enchanted forests, or navigating treacherous terrains, there's something here for every adventurer. (Well... I might add those at one point!)

## For FoundryVTT Users

For those using FoundryVTT, I’ve included importdata files in each map folder. These files allow you to import scenes with walls, lighting, and other elements already set up. **Please note that I am currently using FoundryVTT Version 12. I cannot guarantee that the importdata will work with older versions.** These maps were initially used by me, and may not perfectly match your desired setup in terms of walls and ambiance. Feel free to edit and customize them to suit your needs!

### Overhead Tiles

Some of these maps feature overhead tiles. These tiles are already included in the importdata files. All you need to do is edit them to fit your scene perfectly. (Changing the link of the file basically.)

## A Note from Hoo Hoo

Creating these battlemaps has been a labor of love. I hope they bring as much joy and excitement to your games as they have to mine. Remember, every adventurer's journey is unique, so don't hesitate to make these maps your own.

May your adventures be epic and your battles victorious! GO GAMING !

**Hoo Hoo**
